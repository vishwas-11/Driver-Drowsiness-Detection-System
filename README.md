This project aims to develop a Driver Drowsiness Detection System using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The system is designed to analyze the driver's behavior and alert them in real-time if signs of drowsiness are detected. This can help prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue and enhance overall road safety.

Features :
1. Real-time facial recognition to monitor the driver's face.
2. Detection of key facial features indicative of drowsiness, such as eye closure and head movement.
3. Audio and visual alerts to notify the driver when drowsiness is detected.
4. Integration with in-car systems for seamless deployment.

Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
1. Python (version >= 3.6)
2. OpenCV
3. Dlib
4. NumPy
5. SciPy
6. PyGame (for audio alerts)

Acknowledgments :

The project uses the Dlib library for facial landmark detection.
Special thanks to the open-source community for providing valuable resources.

Disclaimer:
This system is intended for research and educational purposes. Use it responsibly and never rely solely on it for ensuring driver alertness. Always stay attentive and follow traffic safety regulations.
